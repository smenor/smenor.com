      <p>Mick Ashby's「 Ethical Regulator Theorem 」from Cybernetics implies the「 Law of Inevitable Ethical Inadequacy 」which states</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you do not specify that you require a secure ethical system, what you get is an insecure unethical system</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is essential to consider and specify an ethical framework because, if we don't, then we are <em>guaranteed</em> to behave unethically.</p>
<p>Almost anything can be abused to harm someone, but I will not design anything intended to harm or do damage, or that would inevitably lead to harm.</p>
<p>This means I don't make weapons, but it also means that in anything I do, I consider consequences and make my best effort to minimise forseeable adverse consequences.</p>
<h2>Usability</h2>
<p>Anything we make should be as usable as possible by as many potential users as possible.</p>
<p>Among other things, this encompasses what many would consider <em>accessibility</em> <em><strong>BUT</strong></em> with the key distinction that it's not a tacked-on afterthought, but designed in through-and-through at every level and from the beginning.</p>
<h2>Autonomy</h2>
<p>As much as possible, things should get out of the way and not limit choice or constrain options. Automation is great <em>when it works</em> but there <em>must</em> always be a way for any automation to get out of the way quickly and effortlessly when it doesn't.</p>
<h2>Privacy</h2>
<p>Unless essential for their functions, systems should be designed to maximise privacy of anyone who uses or interacts with them.</p>
<h2>Delight</h2>
<p>If we go to the trouble of making something, we should aim to make it a joy to use.</p>
<p>It should <em>look</em> beautiful, <em>feel</em> right. It should be as easy as practical to use to accomplish your goal without getting in your way.</p>
<h2>Respect</h2>
<p>The common thread among all of these and what guides me is <em>respect</em> - by default, I respect you, I expect you to respect me, and anything we work on or make together should respect all stakeholders involved.</p>
<p>Respect is not fear or deference or obsequiousness and sometimes respect means being up-front and telling people things that they don't want to hear but need to.</p>
