      <p>Over the years I've developed a great many valuable skills, and I can do most things along the way of research and development, but there are certain things I can do better than most, and others which I find painful and am not as good at.</p>
<p>I <em>CAN</em> turn a wrench over and over again, and, if you insist, I will.. [ though you can pay someone else a lot less money to do that and they'll probably do it better and faster ] but I'm the guy you pay $10k to hit something with a hammer because I can find the root cause of an issue and address it.</p>
<h2>Finding the Hard Parts</h2>
<p>If you're thinking about making something new, I'm great at figuring out what you're trying to accomplish, coming up with good [ and possibly novel ] ways to do it.</p>
<p>I'm also exceptionally good at finding challenges with various approaches / risks - the gotchas and things that you won't see coming until it's too late.</p>
<h2>Solving Difficult Problems</h2>
<p>One thing I particularly enjoy is finding engineering solutions to difficult problems. Whether it's coming up with something de novo, or putting things tegether in a novel way, figuring out how to do something new is very gratifying to me and generally useful.</p>
<h2>Laying out a Roadmap</h2>
<p>Given an objective, I like thinking through how to get there, including what steps will have to be taken along the way, and assessing where the real work in the journey is hidden. Generally I prefer working in an agile model without having to rigidly impose a brittle schedule or plan, but it's good to figure out at least in broad strokes what the landmarks will be along the way.</p>
<h2>Initial Proof-of-Concept</h2>
<p>Although I've gone through the process of taking an idea from conception through mass-production, and understand and can work through the stages of Engineering, Design, and Production Validation Testing ( EVT, DVT, and PVT ), my strong preference is focusing on the earliest stage proof-of-concept one- or several- off prototypes because that tends to be where many of the most interesting unsolved problems lie.</p>
<h2>Hand-off and ongoing support</h2>
<p>Once the initial research &amp; development / prototyping / small-scale production work is complete, I can put together a complete design package including testing plans, or I can help you do that. I have a lot of experience working with contract manufacturers and doing design-for-manufacturing as well as with design reviews and production / optimisation, and can help you and your partners with those things.</p>
