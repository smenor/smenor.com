      <p>Mechatronics is the intersection of mechanical and electrical systems, generally supported by software / firmware controls, and it is my sweet-spot.</p>
<p>Obviously, I can manage all of the indivual pieces - the mechanical design, circuit and power electronics design, motors/actuators, sensors and control circuits/algorithms, but, what I enjoy most, is putting all those parts together into a coherent whole.</p>
<h2>Mechanical Design</h2>
<h3>Cosmetic, Mechanical, and Structural Parts and Assemblies</h3>
<p>I'm well versed in the design of simple and complex parts and assemblies on scales ranging from millimeters to meters using Solidworks and other tools, including design for thermal management, IP ratings, and to meet UL fire safety and other / regulatory standards.</p>
<h3>Methods</h3>
<p>3D Printing ( DLP, DMLS, FDM, SDA, SLS, others ) CNC milling / latheing, Deep-Draw Forming, Injection Moulding, Sheet Metal, Stamping, Vacuum Forming,..</p>
<h2>Custom PCB Design</h2>
<p>1 through N-layers, many substrates from aluminum / copper, FR4, Rogers, LCP, etc.</p>
<h3>High Speed Digital Signals</h3>
<p>DDR, Ethernet, other high-speed communications in differential pair and other configurations</p>
<h3>Power Electronics</h3>
<p>Milliamps to kiloamps and millivolts through kilovolts AC / DC, offline power, battery charge circuits, power sequencing,..</p>
<h3>Motor Controllers</h3>
<p>Brushed / Brushless motor control, solenoids, linear motors, AC induction, steppers, switched reluctance, transverse and axial flow,..</p>
<h3>Analog Electronics</h3>
<p>Sensors, front-end, filters,</p>
<h3>Digital Signals and Sensors</h3>
<p>Off-board connectors, isolation, avoiding ground-loops and other challenges, signal integrity, and so on..</p>
<h3>Radio-frequency ( communication antennas and RADAR sub-1GHz through â‰ˆ100GHz )</h3>
<p>I've worked from tens of Hertz through hundreds of GHz ( nothing in the THz range yet, but always looking for an excuse / opportunity ), and / of course worked on FCC/CE regulatory compliance for conducted and intentional / unintentional emissions.</p>
<h2>Connectors and Wire Harnesses / Assemblies ( and other ancillary stuff )</h2>
<p>Designing, building, and testing the things that interconnect everything.</p>
<h2>Actuated / Controlled Mechanical Systems</h2>
<p>Design of mechatronics and control software for open- and closed-loop control of electrically driven mechanical / mechatronics systems.</p>
